## KoPilot travel assistant

We are excited to be invited to [the ANU TechLauncher program](https://comp.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/). KoPilot aims to create an innovative travel assistant app that provides the best possible recommendations and just-in-time directions. Our initial focus is on international tourists visiting South Korea. We hope to stand out by offering insights into a treasure trove of Korean-language data not typically accessible to international tourists. Using our custom geospatial and user preference models, along with advanced knowledge graphs, we aim to deliver a truly unique and exciting travel experience. We also believe that the development process, focused on research and solving complex problems, will be just as exciting for our team.

## Project organization

The team will be divided into two sub-teams:

- **Team 1** will focus on the frontend and backend development.
- **Team 2** will focus on designing the recommendation system to suggest a list of items to visit next, including sightseeing spots, restaurants, and social events.
